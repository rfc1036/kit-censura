** What is this? **

cen|sù|ra: controllo esercitato da un'autorità civile o religiosa su
pubblicazioni, spettacoli, mezzi di informazione, per adeguarli ai
principi della legge, di una religione o di una dottrina morale.
(Tullio De Mauro, il dizionario della lingua italiana.)

censor [transitive verb]: to suppress or delete as objectionable.
(Merriam-Webster's Online dictionary.)

Censorship is the removal or withholding of information from the public
by a controlling group or body. (Wikipedia entry for Censorship.)

This suite of programs implements by-domain and by-IP censorship of the
Internet. It is designed to be able to accomodate multiple blacklists
and be easily extensible.

** Usage **

Many scripts contain configuration variables. Read and understand each
one before before running them.
Start from censorship-get and then censorship-apply.

The install-routes-linux script can be run directly on a border router
or on a system where a dynamic routing protocol will redistribute the
static routes it installs.


** Name servers configuration **

Something like this should be added to the main configuration file of
your name server daemon:

# named.conf (BIND)
include "/etc/bind/censura/named.conf";

# unbound.conf (Unbound)
include: "/etc/unbound/censura.conf"

and the db.* files need to be copied in the $CONFDIR directory configured
in the build-bind-config script (default: /etc/bind/censura/).

The list of your name servers must be configured in the upload-bind-config
script.
