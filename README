** What is this? **

cen|sù|ra: controllo esercitato da un'autorità civile o religiosa su
pubblicazioni, spettacoli, mezzi di informazione, per adeguarli ai
principi della legge, di una religione o di una dottrina morale.
(Tullio De Mauro, il dizionario della lingua italiana.)

censor [transitive verb]: to suppress or delete as objectionable.
(Merriam-Webster's Online dictionary.)

Censorship is the removal or withholding of information from the public
by a controlling group or body. (Wikipedia entry for Censorship.)

This suite of programs implements by-domain and by-IP censorship of the
Internet. It is designed to be able to accomodate multiple blacklists
and be easily extensible.

the deployment this software.

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.


** Usage **

Many scripts contain configuration variables that are stored in config.sh. 
Read and understand each one before before running them.
Start from censorship-get and then censorship-apply.

Before starting make sure to run the bootstrap script in working path:

# bash bootstrap.sh

The install-routes-linux script can be run directly on a border router
or on a system where a dynamic routing protocol will redistribute the
static routes it installs.

BIG WARNING: This project is meant to be a TOOLKIT to meet the legal 
requirements of censorship in Italy and IT IS NOT meant to be used as 
it is or as a stand-alone all-in-one solution. 
It must be adapted and customised to YOUR systems and needs. 
Feel free to modify, enable and disable features as needed.

** Cron requirements **

censorship-cron is the script to be called via cron:

# run every 6 hours
27  */6  * * *     root   /root/kit-censura/censorship-cron  &> /dev/null

If you are using the Piracy Shield Client by AIIP see README.pscaiip

** Logging and Alerting **

You can enable Logging and Alerting by changing config.sh file.
By default the log file is placed on /var/log/kit-censura.log

If log rotation is needed there is a template for logrotate in 
examples/kit-censura.logrotate file ready to be edited and moved on 
logrotate.d directory.

Alerting is triggered only when downloads fails for some reasons and
send an email of warning at the address specified in config.sh file.
Just be sure that sendmail tool is working propely.

** Name servers configuration **

Something like this should be added to the main configuration file of
your name server daemon:

# named.conf (BIND)
include "/etc/bind/censura/named.conf";

# unbound.conf (Unbound)
include: "/etc/unbound/censura.conf"

and the db.* files need to be copied in the $CONFDIR directory configured
in the build-bind-config script (default: /etc/bind/censura/).

The list of your name servers must be configured in the upload-bind-config
script.
