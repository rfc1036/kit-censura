** What is this? **

cen|sù|ra: controllo esercitato da un'autorità civile o religiosa su
pubblicazioni, spettacoli, mezzi di informazione, per adeguarli ai
principi della legge, di una religione o di una dottrina morale.
(Tullio De Mauro, il dizionario della lingua italiana.)

censor [transitive verb]: to suppress or delete as objectionable.
(Merriam-Webster's Online dictionary.)

Censorship is the removal or withholding of information from the public
by a controlling group or body. (Wikipedia entry for Censorship.)

This suite of programs implements by-domain and by-IP censorship of the
Internet. It is designed to be able to accomodate multiple blacklists
and be easily extensible.

** Usage **

Many scripts contain configuration variables that are stored in config.sh. 
Read and understand each one before before running them.
Start from censorship-get and then censorship-apply.

Before starting make sure to run the bootstrap script in working path:

bash bootstrap.sh

The install-routes-linux script can be run directly on a border router
or on a system where a dynamic routing protocol will redistribute the
static routes it installs.

** Logging and Alerting **

You can enable Logging and Alerting by changing config.sh file.
By default the log file is placed on /var/log/kit-censura.log

If log rotation is needed there is a template for logrotate in 
kit-censura.logrotate file ready to be edited and moved on 
logrotate.d directory.

Alerting is triggered only when downloads fails for some reasons and
send an email of warning at the address specified in config.sh file.
Just be sure that sendmail tool is working propely.

** Name servers configuration **

Something like this should be added to the main configuration file of
your name server daemon:

# named.conf (BIND)
include "/etc/bind/censura/named.conf";

# unbound.conf (Unbound)
include: "/etc/unbound/censura.conf"

and the db.* files need to be copied in the $CONFDIR directory configured
in the build-bind-config script (default: /etc/bind/censura/).

The list of your name servers must be configured in the upload-bind-config
script.
